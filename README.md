## About
Matter Overdrive is a Minecraft mod inspired by the popular Sci-fi TV series Star Trek. It dwells in the concept of replicating and transforming one type matter into another.
Although it may seem overpowered, Matter Overdrive takes a more realistic approach and requires the player to build a complex system before even the simplest replication can be achieved.

## Issues:

https://github.com/oupanyu/MatterOverdrive-Fabric/issues

Todo:

1. Allow energy transfer across matter network cables. That way connectivity and power go over one set of cables.
2. Make the microwave able to "cook" food like furnaces do, getting power from RF. If ores are put in the microwave, make it explode.
3. Fix network flash drives to properly filter destinations.
